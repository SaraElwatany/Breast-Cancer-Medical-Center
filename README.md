# ðŸ©º Breast Cancer Medical Center Web Application
This repository contains the implementation of a Breast Cancer Medical Center Web Application, designed to serve both client (patient) and server (doctors/admin) sides.

- Server Side:

Manage appointments, doctors, and patients with full database operations (add, update, delete).
Upload DICOM medical images and get support from a Decision Support System (DSS) that classifies the image as normal, benign, malignant, etc.


- Client Side:

Book and track appointments easily.
Access personal medical data and history.


This project aims to provide an efficient and accurate platform for medical diagnosis and patient management.
